# Configuring Microsoft SQL Server for DreamFactory

Configuring [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.dreamfactory.com/hub/integrations/microsoft-sql-server/) for use with DreamFactory is a two-step process:

* Configure your SQL Server instance to accept ODBC connections.
* Configure your DreamFactory server to allow PHP to talk to SQL Server.

This is a pretty straightforward process, with the former's instructions varying slightly according to SQL Server version. So to make things really easy, we've broken this chapter up accordingly.

* Microsoft SQL Server 2017

* Microsoft SQL Server 2013
