### Downloading Couchbase

### Installing Couchbase

Press Setup New Cluster

Create Cluster Name, Create Admin Username, and password. Press `Next: Accept Terms`.

On the next screen you'll be prompted to review and accept the legalese. After finishing doing so, you can choose either `Finish With Defaults` or `Configure Disk, Memory, Services`. If you're just experimenting with Couchbase then selecting `Finish with Defaults`.

Taken to the Dashboard

If you're already familiar with Couchbase then you can click on `Buckets` to add a new bucket. Otherwise I suggest clicking on the `load a sample bucket` link at the bottom of the dashboard to load example data and indexes.

For the purposes of this tutorial I've chosen the `travel-sample` sample. After choosing your sample you can click on the `Buckets` link located in the left menu.
