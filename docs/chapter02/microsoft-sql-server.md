# Configuring Microsoft SQL Server for DreamFactory

Configuring Microsoft SQL Server for use with DreamFactory is a two-step process:

* Configure your SQL Server instance to accept ODBC connections.
* Configure your DreamFactory server to allow PHP to talk to SQL Server.

This is a pretty straightforward process, with the former's instructions varying slightly according to SQL Server version. So to make things really easy, we've broken this chapter up accordingly.

## Step #1. Configuring Your Microsoft SQL Server

* Microsoft SQL Server 2017

* Microsoft SQL Server 2013

* Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Vista Service Pack 2
