Security FAQ</h1> <p><strong>Briefly summarize the service offering, identifying the location of data being stored, the type of data being stored, transmission details (how frequently, through what mechanisms), and any aspects of the service that use subcontractors or are outsourced.

This is rarely requested and only in circumstances where DreamFactory product support is directly assisting the customer with debugging and/or product support.</li> <li>DreamFactory occasionally utilizes a trusted third party for technical support and coding for product updates. During this process, third parties have no access to customer data and all lines of code are audited and individually reviewed by DreamFactory’s Chief Technical Officer (CTO).</li> <li>No sensitive, confidential, or other protected data is stored by DreamFactory beyond contact and billing information required for business transactions.</li></ul> <p><strong>Do you have a third party security assessment and certification of your information security controls?

Can you supply a copy?</strong></p> <ul><li>Currently, DreamFactory does not have a third party security assessment or certification of its information security controls.</li> <li>Beginning in Q3, DreamFactory will be implementing quarterly internal reviews of its security policies and procedures, and annual third party reviews.
